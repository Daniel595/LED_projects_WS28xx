# interactive LED table

A table that lights up  where it gets touched.

A simplyfied recreation from http://blog.deconinck.info/post/2016/12/19/A-Dirt-Cheap-F-Awesome-Led-Table. My table has no such cool "light patterns" as Deconink's because Glediator does not work here. In return it starts up very quickly and you never have to access a GUI.
