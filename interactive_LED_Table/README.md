# interactive LED_Table
Simply a table that lights up where you touch it!

I reproduced the interactive LED-Table from http://blog.deconinck.info/post/2016/12/19/A-Dirt-Cheap-F-Awesome-Led-Table as case-study project for university. 

I'm rewriting all the Java-stuff in C, so the current code couldn't be used at the moment.

## TODO
rewrite code in c/c++
